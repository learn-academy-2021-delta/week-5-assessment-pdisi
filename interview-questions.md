# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Are (most) Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer: The most common Ruby methods are accessors. The built in methods usually only access information instead of changing it.

  Researched answer: For example methods such as .length, .first, .last are far more common than methods such as .pop.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: I believe blocks include code that can be called upon. One example would be a "do" block.

  Researched answer: Blocks can also be identified between braces and end statements. Methods are nested within them and can be called upon.



3. What is a gem?

  Your answer: Gem is a library that works specifically for ruby and I believe that is called a relational database. It is comparable to yarn for javascript.

  Researched answer: It is equivalent to a plugin or extension specifically designed for Ruby programming. They are all independent of other systems and act as a crutch to modify the operations within ruby apps.



4. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: I believe that this is a database that stores information that is similarly related. However, I also think that these are designed to support specific programs.

  Researched answer: Relational databases allow people to access data among multiple databases. They will have extensive amounts of tabs that are capable of relating to eachother. An example of a relational database is SQL.



5. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: I am not entirely sure on this one, but I believe that a primary key may be referenced to groups of data, or the starting point of a group of data.

  Researched answer: An example of a primary key would be the title of a column in a database that refers to information within it that is capable of coinciding with. Primary keys seem to be unique as they need to be called upon without confusion. They may also be referred to as a primary keyword. Relational databases only have one primary key.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. RESTful routes: The underlying framework that connects HTTP verbs to CRUD actions (create, read, update, delete). When something follows the REST principles it is known as RESTFUL. They are a conventional pattern that is followed when designing routes for the interaction whenever a request is made by a user.

2. JSON: It is a programming langauge that utilizes simple english and objects to execute code. It is known as JavaScript Object Notation. It is used to store and transport data.

3. ERB: It is a system used to template and embed Ruby code into a text document. It stands for Embedded Ruby and is capable of transforming Ruby code into HTML code for rendering purposes.

4. Params: Short for parameter. They are values that are used to pass information to methods. This would be the equivalent action of a "get" to "post" in Ruby.

5. API: Application Programming Interface. It is a set of protocols and definitions for building and integrating softare applications. "APIs are sometimes thought of as contracts, with documentation that represents an agreement between parties: If party 1 sends a remote request structured a particular way, this is how party 2â€™s software will respond."
